Module 15

# Overview of the analysis:

In this analysis, we are going to review the the bike sharing system CitiBike from New York, to replicate in another city.
A potential angel investor wants to see data to analyze certain trends and get a better understanding on how the general public used this product. 
Using data sets from CitiBike's system data page, python, and tableau, we will visualize data to understand the consumer's patterns.

As we can see in the below image, we will be taking into consideration the total number of riders and a breakdown of that number into the different genders.

We start the analysis with a breakdown of the checkout times by gender, being able to quickly determine that short rides are more popular than longer ones.

We can also see thanks to the below visualizations, that the majority of the rides start in midtow.

With the following visualization, we can have a clear idea that the user that is suscribed to CityBike takes a much higher number of rides than the general customer.

Looking at the number of rides per hour per weekday, seems like the peak times for CitiBike riders are during the rush hour periods (around 7AM to 10AM and 4PM to 7PM). 
We can also determine that during the weekend, the number of riders is much more uniform throughout the day instead of having two distinct peaks.
